# CANCER PROYECT
Monovariable assay porbably only including BM (petos paradox thingy)
People likey (not weighted covariances suck)

#### About the different scenarios
Fexibilize this in some way looking at diff combinations (maybe that sorta eigenvector structures through some automatation such as permutations?)
Perfect conservation of AA in top -> two fams (check this out)

#### CAAS AND RER
Different scenarios apply to CAAS analysis and will be compared/added to the results of RERs.
The basis is doing pretty much what has been done up until now with a more flexible scenario setting leading to a wider gamut of CAAS discovery

#### GO / Pathway enrichment analysis (?)
TBC
Protein network (String?)
- Protein-Protein Interaction Networks
- Functional Enrichment Analysis
- Centrality / protein interaction stuff?

### ABOUT ACTUAL METHODOLOGY
##### Gene Discovery
- RERConverge: once per phenotype FOR THE WHOLE PHYLOGENY (nextflow?)
- CAASTools: tricky because of the scenarios. Some possibilities that must be taken into account
##### Testing
- RERC: no biggies
- CAASTools: Bootstrapping IS demanding. So do the discovery stage, see if there's something interesting in the in-silico analysis, get to the bootstraping stage.
##### Metadata / In-Silico Funtional Analysis
- GO, KEGG and those thingies
